# GS15Project
GS15 IT project - Cryptography - Engineering school: Troyes University of Technology - 2019.  As part of our cryptography course, we want to create a secure communication tool. We will implement cryptographic tools: certificates for authentication, signature (hashage) and symmetric encryption. We will create a menu in order to test individually the implemented algorithms.
